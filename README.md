# Homework Three: Password Generator

This is a password generator that prompts you to answer these questions:
Between 8 and 128, how long do you want your password?
Would you like uppercase letters?
Would you like numerical values?
Would you like special characters?

If you do not answer the first question with a valid number, but with a letter or number below or above, then it will return this alert message:
Please input a valid number between 8 and 128.
And it will also say "Try Again" in the password generator textbox.
You click the "Generate Password" button, and it will restart the function.

All other questions have a confirmation or cancel response to limit the answer choice. This took some testing to fix, and should have been an obvious answer in the beginning. 

If all answers are given correctly, then all prompts will go through and the password will be generated in the text box.
